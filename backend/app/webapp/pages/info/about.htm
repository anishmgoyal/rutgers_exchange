		<h4>About Us</h4>
		<p>
			Rutgers Exchange was created to make buying and selling things like Textbooks easier for Rutgers students. Also, it was
			created to let sellers filter through offers, and only share their contact information with buyers who are willing to offer
			a fair price for their listings.

			That being said, this service is still in beta. There's a lot that still hasn't been added to it yet. If something seems
			to be broken, don't hesitate to email support@rutgersxchange.com to let us know what's wrong.
		</p>

			We are also eager to hear your thoughts on this service. Please send us any feedback you have at support@rutgersxchange.com.
