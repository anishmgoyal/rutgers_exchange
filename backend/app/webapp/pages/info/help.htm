		<p>This page is still not finished, so please email support@rutgersxchange.com if you are still having trouble using Rutgers Exchange.</p>
		<h4>Basic Use</h4>
		<p>
			Whether you are trying to buy or sell things, you need to be logged in to Rutgers Exchange. Without logging in, you can
			view a list of items for sale, but you cannot place offers or contact sellers.
		</p>
		<h4>Buying</h4>
		<p>
			From the main page, you can browse recently added listings. To see more, click "Listings" in the menu. This will expand a list
			of categories which listings can be sorted under in Rutgers Exchange. Choose the most relevant category, and browse the items
			listed until you find what you want. You can then click on the photo of the item to view more information about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternatively, you can use the search tool to help you find listings based off of certain keywords. On a desktop, the search
			bar is at the top of the page. On a mobile device, there will be a magnifying glass icon on the top of the page which you can
			click on to open the search bar
		<p>
			After viewing information about a listing, if you still wish to proceed, click on the "Make an Offer" button (which will be
			under the listing's name on the listing's page). Enter the dollar amount you would be willing to pay for the item, and click
			"Place Offer".
		</p>
		<p>
			After your offer is placed, you will need to wait for the seller to take action. The seller may choose to accept or reject
			the offer you made. Until the seller takes action, you can edit your offer amount by clicking "Offers" in the menu. The
			offers page has a list of offers you have made as a buyer, as well as offers you have received as a seller. Next to each
			offer you have made as a buyer, there is a button which says "Edit Offer". You can use this to bring up the Edit Offer
			page, which looks very similar to the Place Offer page. Enter your new amount, and click the button at the bottom of the form.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your offer is accepted, a conversation between you and the seller will be opened. You can view a list of your active
			conversations by clicking on "Messages" in the menu. You can use that page to coordinate your sale with the seller, or
			share other contact information with the seller.
		</p>
		<h4>Selling</h4>
		<p>
			If you are logged in, you can click on "My Listings" to see any listings you have posted. To add a new listing, click
			on the button at the top of the page (which says "New Listing"). This will open a form in which you can add basic
			information about your product. After entering this information, you can either add images to your listing, save
			your listing as a draft, or save and publish your listing.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you choose to save your listing as a draft, only you can view your listing. You can always publish a draft later
			by navigating to the draft in "My Listings", and clicking on the "Publish" button at the top of the Listing's page.
			If you choose to save and publish your listing, anyone (logged in or not) can view the details of your listing. You
			can always revert a listing to a draft by navigating to the draft in "My Listings", clicking the "Edit" button at
			the top of the listing's page, and finally clicking the "Revert to Draft" button at the bottom of the page.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you choose to add images to your listing, follow the instruction on the image uploader page. After adding images,
			you can sort them by clicking on the images in the order in which they should appear. As you click on images, each
			will be assigned a number. If you want to reset an image, click on it again. Its number will disappear, and the other
			images with numbers will be adjusted to reflect this change. Any images without numbers will be displayed in the
			order in which they were uploaded AFTER all images with numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can make any changes to a listing by navigating to it in "My Listings" and clicking on the "Edit" button at the
			top of the listing page. To edit the listing's images, click on the "Manage Images" button at the bottom of the page.
		</p>
		<p>
			After creating and publishing your listing, potential buyers will be able to see it. If a potential buyer makes an
			offer, you can view this offer by clicking "Offers" in the menu, then clicking on the "Seller" tab. This will list
			any listings for which you have received offers. You can accept or reject individual offers by clicking on the
			"See All" button next to any listing.
		</p>
		<p>
			After accepting an offer, a conversation will be started between you and the buyer. You can view a list of your active
			conversations by clicking on "Messages" in the menu. You can use that page to coordinate your sale with the buyer, or
			share other contact information with the buyer. After completing the sale, you can mark the listing sold by clicking
			"Finalize Transaction" at the top of the conversation. If you decide not to go through with the sale, you can click
			"Reject Offer" at the top of the conversation to delete the offer and conversation.
